## **Problem Statement:**
  - The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing.
However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which
can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually
can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions.
  
  - A machinelearning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques
such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging
algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.

  - Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A
lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on
how likely they are to become a customer .

  - You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and
remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.

## **Approach**

**1) Data Understanding:** 
- Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical)
and their distributions. Some rubbish values are present in ‘Material_Reference’
which starts with ‘00000’ value which should be converted into null. Treat
reference columns as categorical variables. INDEX may not be useful.

**2) Data Preprocessing:**
  -  Handle missing values with mean/median/mode.
  - Treat Outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest from sklearn library.
  - Identify Skewness in the dataset and treat skewness with appropriate
data transformations, such as log transformation(which is best suited to
transform target variable-train, predict and then reverse transform it back
to original scale eg:dollars), boxcox transformation, or other techniques,
to handle high skewness in continuous variables.
  - Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques, such as one-hot
encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding, based on their nature and
relationship with the target variable.

**3) EDA:**
 
 - Try visualizing outliers and skewness(before and after treating skewness)
using Seaborn’s boxplot, distplot, violinplot.

**4) Feature Engineering:**
  - Engineer new features if applicable, such as aggregating
or transforming existing features to create more informative representations of
the data. And drop highly correlated columns using SNS HEATMAP.

**5) Model Building and Evaluation:**

- Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets.

- Train and evaluate different classification models, such as
ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier, or Logistic Regression, using
appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and AUC curve.

- Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as
cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing model.

- Interpret the model results and assess its performance based on the
defined problem statement.

- Same steps for Regression modelling.(note: dataset contains more noise
and linearity between independent variables so itll perform well only with
tree based models)

**6) Model GUI:** 

- Using streamlit module, create interactive page with
    - (1) task input( Regression or Classification) and
    - (2) create an input field where you can enter each column value except
‘Selling_Price’ for regression model and except ‘Status’ for classification
model.

    - (3) perform the same feature engineering, scaling factors, log/any
transformation steps which you used for training ml model and predict this new
data from streamlit and display the output.

**7) Tips:** 

- Use pickle module to dump and load models such as encoder(onehot/
label/ str.cat.codes /etc), scaling models(standard scaler), ML models. First fit
and then transform in separate line and use transform only for unseen data
